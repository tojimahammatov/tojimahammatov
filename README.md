- 👋 Hi, I’m Sherzodbek
- 👀 I’m interested in:
- 		'Software Engineering': ['Back-end', 'Python', 'FastAPI', 'Database', 'Kafka'], 
  		'AI': ['Deep Learning', '2D/3D Object Detection', 'Change Detection', 'Pose Estimation'],
        'Cloud': ['AWS', 'AWS EC2', 'AWS RDS', 'AWS S3']
- 🌱 I've worked on 3D Object Detection, few results from NuScenes dataset are [here](https://github.com/tojimahammatov/tojimahammatov/tree/main/assets).
- 🌱 Currently I'm working on developing microservices on top of 2D Change Detection models to find a change in two frames in real time.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate on any interesting topics ranging from Software Engineering to Deep Learning.
- 📫 You can reach me via email.
